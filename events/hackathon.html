            </b>
            <p>"Problem/Current Situation: INCOIS is providing Marine Fishery Advisory Services to the fishermen. To
                evaluate its accuracy and in order to develop species-specific advisories it is necessary to collect the
                fish-catch information at the species level. While fisherfolk are supportive to these efforts, often
                species level catch reporting is having hindrances due to several reasons pertaining to manual efforts
                which results in low or erroneous reporting. Solution Needed: Hackathon teams may develop AI-ML based
                tools for image-based identification of fish-species found in the Indian seas. The images of fishes may
                be taken from online image searches. Similar tools are provided in reference links below. INCOIS will be
                able to use this for it’s fishermen feedback app, where fishermen need to take a photo of fishes caught
                and fish-identification will be done through code, minimising the manual intervention. Datasets Link (If
                any): https://lens.linne.ai/en/, https://fishbase.in/".</p>

                build. Later, by mistake, staff may tend to install software that is freely available over the
                internet, which in turn may pave the way to viruses/spyware/spamware which potentially paralyse the
                network. Develop a software (scheduler based) to track the list of all software installed on the PCs
                & Workstations attached to the network and generate a report based on IPs. The report may be sent to
                the admin and the admin should be able to delete or uninstall the software of a particular user’s
                system. To track the list of software installed in the PCs / Workstations attached to the network.

                Develop an AI/ML model which can tackle these problems and improvise the education system. Today our

                infrastructure, qualified teachers, quality of education, low awareness of importance of education,
                etc. are just a small portion of challenges which holds back development.

                "Background: Some time it is difficult for hearing impaired person to overcome with the noise
                environments and other difficulties with hearing aid usages in day-to-day communication and
                activities. It is important to ensure the additional features of alerting battery life, usage of
                hearing aid instructions twice in a day and care maintenance of it and it also should be link with
                mobile application.Summary: Detection and Alerts in hearing aids for deaf and hearing impairment
                Objective: 1. The hearing aids additional feature must be protected by manufactures. 2. Connecting
                features with mobile application will be easy to track their hearing aid conditions. 3. To avoid
                utilisation of hearing aids in day to day life."
